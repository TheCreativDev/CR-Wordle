# Fonts

## Add `supercell-magic.ttf`

1. Copy your font file into this folder:
   - `fonts/supercell-magic.ttf`

2. The project registers the font via `@font-face` in `css/attribute-cells.css`.

3. In Developer Studio, select **Supercell Magic** in the **Font** dropdown.

Notes:
- Keep the filename exactly `supercell-magic.ttf` (lowercase) unless you also update the CSS `url(...)`.
- If you want WOFF/WOFF2 for smaller downloads later, we can add those sources too.
